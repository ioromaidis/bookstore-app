## Bookstore app

The app includes a client workspace which hosts the FE and a server workspace that runs
a simple server just to demonstrate asynchronous data handling. No DB or error handling/ data validation is used on the
server side.

The implemented features are:

- Book Search with filters
- Book Detail View
- Book Create
- Book Category
- Comments

Once you have pnpm run the following from the root directory:

- ```pnpm install```
- ```pnpm run dev```
